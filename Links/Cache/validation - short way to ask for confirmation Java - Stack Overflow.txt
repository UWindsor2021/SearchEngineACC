Learn more short way to ask for confirmation Java Ask Question Asked 7 years, 8 months ago Active 7 years, 8 months ago Viewed 1k times 0 I'm trying to find a way to ask the user a yes/no question that validates that the input is only yes (y/Y) or no (n/N). I'm trying to cut down on variables, while still keeping it readable. So far this is what I've come up with: import java.util.Scanner;

public class InputValidation
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        String answer;

        do
        {
            System.out.print("Do you wish to proceed? (Y/N): ");
            answer = input.next().trim().toUpperCase();
            yesAnswer = answer.equals("Y");
        } while (answer.matches("[YN]"));

        if (yesAnswer)
        {
            // Do something
        }
        else
        {
            // Do something else
        }
    }
}
 I'm not necessarily looking for the least amount of characters; more something that's short and flexible. Any ideas? java validation performance Share Follow edited Mar 20 '14 at 5:01 mklein994 asked Mar 20 '14 at 4:54 mklein994mklein994 311 silver badge44 bronze badges Add a comment | 1 Answer 1 Active Oldest Votes 2 Depending on what you want to achieve, I would probably simply evaluate the input directly, before determing the actual result, for example do {
    System.out.print("Do you wish to proceed? (Y/N): ");
    answer = input.next().trim().toUpperCase();
} while (!answer.matches("[YN]"));
boolean yesAnswer = answer.equalsIgnoreCase("Y");
 This basically waits until the answer matches Y, N, y, n before determine yesAnswer. The next thing I might do is wrap it in method... if (askYesNo("Do you wish to proceed? (Y/N): ")) {...
 You could then go onto providing optional exit conditions to the method.. askYesNo("Delete all files [Ok/Cancel]", "(ok)?", "(cancel)?")
 For example... public class YesNo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        if (askYesNo("Do you wish to proceed? (Y/N): ")) {
            System.out.println("Okay...");
        }

        if (askYesNo("Delete all Files? (Okay/Cancel): ", "okay", "cancel")) {
            System.out.println("Make it so");
        }
    }

    public static boolean askYesNo(String question) {
        return askYesNo(question, "[Y]", "[N]");
    }

    public static boolean askYesNo(String question, String positive, String negative) {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        // Convert everything to upper case for simplicity...
        positive = postive.toUpperCase();
        negative = negative.toUpperCase();
        String answer;
        do {
            System.out.print(question);
            answer = input.next().trim().toUpperCase();
        } while (!answer.matches(positive) && !answer.matches(negative));
        // Assess if we match a positive response
        return answer.matches(positive);
    }
}

Right? – mklein994 Mar 20 '14 at 5:13 @mklein994 Yeah, I was thinking that to, maybe even seperating the "positive" and "negative" response as two parameters... – MadProgrammer Mar 20 '14 at 5:14 The question marks are just field delimiters, so I could use something like .split("?") – mklein994 Mar 20 '14 at 5:18 @mklein994 Of course you could simply compile your own Pattern configured to ignore the case ;) – MadProgrammer Mar 20 '14 at 5:19 @mklein994 But which are positive and which are negative response?? – MadProgrammer Mar 20 '14 at 5:19 | Show 1 more comment Your Answer Thanks for contributing an answer to Stack Overflow!
